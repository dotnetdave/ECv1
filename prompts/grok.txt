Instruction for Grok:
- Keep EC v1 blocks verbatim (no wrapping or reflow). Three lines only.
- When replying with EC v1, use `t=none;ct=json` in this chat unless explicitly asked otherwise.
- If parsing fails, answer: "I cannot parse this EC v1 block."

Response acknowledgment template:
Got it. Processing EC v1 payload.
