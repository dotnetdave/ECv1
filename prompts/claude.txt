Instruction for Claude:
- Do not rewrite or reformat EC v1 blocks; keep each line exact.
- EC v1 has exactly three lines: `EC v1`, `t=<transform>;ct=<content_type>`, payload.
- Use `t=none;ct=json` when you send an EC v1 payload back in this chat.
- If the block cannot be parsed, reply: "I cannot parse this EC v1 block."

Response acknowledgment template:
Understood. Processing EC v1 payload.
