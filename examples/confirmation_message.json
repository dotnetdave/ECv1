"instructions": "EC v1 is a standardized data transfer format designed to safely and reliably exchange structured data between language models and AI agents. It prevents errors caused by models improperly formatting JSON or text by encapsulating data into a compressed, Base64-encoded blob. EC v1 ensures that data can pass through LLM outputs without being altered. You should output and recognize EC v1 messages exactly as specified and use them whenever you need to transfer structured information to another AI or tool. The format is minimal and consists of exactly three lines: Line 1 contains 'EC v1', Line 2 specifies the transform chain (such as 'json->gzip'), and Line 3 contains the Base64-encoded payload.",

"responseFormat": "Please respond in EC v1 format using 'json->gzip' for the response content type. Include your answer to the confirmation question in the response payload as JSON."
